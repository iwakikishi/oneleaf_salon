            I acknowledge that I have been informed of the daily maintenance for hair extensions and have been told how to properly take care of them
            and my natural hair. I understand that the extensions are more sensitive than my intact human hair. I agree to properly brush and take
            care of my extensions and if I fail to do so or fail to make it back into the salon for regular upkeep, that I may see wear and tear on my
            natural hair in which case the salon and my stylist are not liable for.

            I agree to pay a 1 non-refundable deposit at the time of booking, and an additional 2 due at the time of service. This means I agree to
            pay 3 as my overall total for my desired services. I acknowledge that my stylist and I have agreed on a specific color and method for my
            extensions and if that should change before the time of install, an additional deposit may be required. I understand that in the event I
            do need to reschedule my appointment I will give my stylist a 48-hour notice and my deposit will be transferred to a new appointment. If I
            fail to do so an additional deposit may be required. If I cancel my appointment entirely I understand I will not receive my deposit back.
            If I decide I do not want to keep my extensions in, I understand there will be a removal fee.
